## Project Description
---
You are hired by a company Gem Stones co ltd, which is a cubic zirconia manufacturer. You are provided with the dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 27,000 cubic zirconia (an inexpensive diamond alternative with many of the same qualities as a diamond). The company is earning different profits on different prize slots. You have to help the company in predicting the price for the stone based on the details given in the dataset so it can distinguish between higher profitable stones and lower profitable stones to have a better profit share. 
## Objective
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data wrangling, and building a regression model to predict gemstone prices based on features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity.
## Dataset Description
The dataset contains data about cubic zirconia gemstones, including various features that influence their price. You must explore, clean, and analyze the data, draw meaningful insights, and create predictive models.
## Dataset Explanation
Refer to ‚ÄúGemstone_Dataset_Dictionary‚Äù document file.


## Tasks

1.	Data Cleaning:
- Handle missing values.
- Remove duplicate entries.
- Correct inconsistencies in the data.
- Detect and handle outliers.

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Generate summary statistics for the dataset.
- Visualize the distribution of each feature.
- Explore relationships between features using scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.
- Identify any patterns or trends in the data.

3.	Data Wrangling:
- Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Create new features if beneficial for the analysis.

4.	Insights and Conclusions:
- Draw meaningful insights from the data.
- Summarize critical findings.
- Provide recommendations based on the analysis.

5.	Building a Regression Model:
- Use the cleaned and preprocessed dataset to build a regression model predicting gemstone prices.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance using:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R¬≤ score
- Explore how model performance changes with different features or transformations.
- Summarize findings and assess the model's effectiveness in predicting gemstone prices.
